# SIIAM
This repository includes published works in which I have been involved within SIIAM (Italian Society for Artificial intelligence in Medicine).

Here you can find: 
- [Italian edition of the WHO Guidelines on the ethics and governance of artificial intelligence for health](https://github.com/ANDREAaNAPPI/SIIAM/blob/main/LG-AI-IT-def_1.pdf)
  Etica e governance dell'intelligenza artificiale per la salute is the italian adaptation, translated from english and placed in the italian healthcare reality, of the WHO guidelines on etics and governance of artificial intelligence for health.
